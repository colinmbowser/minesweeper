# Overview

This program is a basic minesweeper program written in Javascript and minorly used HTML and CSS. This was the first time that I have coded in javascript and I enjoyed the language.

This program was written because I really like minesweeper and it is no longer on my computer so I thought it would be fun to program the game myself, instead of downloading a new version of it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create this program with javascript extension and the live server extension.
