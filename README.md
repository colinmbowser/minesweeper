# Overview

This program is a basic minesweeper program written in Javascript and minorly used HTML and CSS. This was the first time that I have coded in javascript and I enjoyed the language.

This program was written because I really like minesweeper and it is no longer on my computer so I thought it would be fun to program the game myself, instead of downloading a new version of it.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create this program with javascript extension and the live server extension.

* Add an Easy, Medium and Hard button to change the difficulty at the beginning
